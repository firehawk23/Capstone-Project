    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project deals with discussing the neighborhoods of Chennai, The Detroit of India. This would specifically help Business people planning to start Restaurants, Hotels, etc. in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Foursquare API is used to access the venues in the neighborhoods. Since, it returns less venues in the neighborhoods, we would be analysing areas for which countable number of venues are obtained. Then they are clustered based on their venues using Data Science Techniques. Here the k-means clustering algorithm is used to achieve the task. The optimal number of clusters can be obtained using silhouette score metrics. Folium visualization library can be used to visualize the clusters superimposed on the map of Chennai city. These clusters can be analyzed to help small scale business owners select a suitable location for their need such as Hotels, Shopping Malls, Restaurants or even specifically Indian restaurants or Coffee shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Which Tried to Solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "The major Target Audience would be small-scale business owners and stake holders planning to start their business at a location in Chennai. This project would help them find the optimal location based on the category of their business such as,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the best location to start a new hotel in Chennai with restaurants around?\n",
    "2. Which area is best suitable for opening a Shopping Mall in Chennai?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foursquare API:\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work Flow:\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering Approach:\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n",
    "\n",

    "## Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:\n",
    "Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n",
